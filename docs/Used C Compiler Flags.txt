C Compiler Flags

-ffunction-sections
	Eliminate unused code.

-Os
	Optimize for size. -Os enables all -O2 optimizations
	except those that often increase code size:

	-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
	-falign-labels  -falign-loops 
	-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc
	
	It also enables -finline-functions, causes the compiler
	to tune for code size rather than execution speed, and
	performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size.

-fdata-sections
	Eliminate unused ELF symbols.

-Wall
	Turns on lots of compiler warning flags, specifically:
	-Waddress -Wcomment -Wformat -Wbool-compare
	-Wuninitialized -Wunknown-pragmas -Wunused-value
	-Wunused-value â€¦

-fvisibility=hidden
	=> Make library symbols hidden by default, in a similar way to what happens in Windows DLLs where exported symbols must have the prefix __declspec(dllexport) or __declspec(dllimport). When all symbols are exported by default, it may increase the likelyhood of undefined behavior if there a multiple definitions of same symbol during linking. See more at:
